The project is not yet publishing stable semantic-versioned releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Versioned `mem.handoff` v1 checkpoints, optimistic head comparison,
  deterministic `resume`, and task/checkpoint list/get inspection across API,
  CLI and MCP.
- Portable workspace bundle v1 with manifest, seven typed indexes, immutable
  checkpoint payloads, content-addressed blobs, checksums and dependency
  validation.
- Resource-bounded workspace export and empty-target `fresh` import across
  API, typed client, CLI and Web, including idempotent import ledger,
  structured/truncated conflicts and failure compensation.
- Web Drive trust surfaces for Tasks, checkpoint/Resume, Memories lifecycle
  control and Workspace Transfer.
- Real-image visual regression coverage and an opt-in multilingual CLIP
  ranking gate with an explicit checked-in baseline report.
- Model-independent structured Agent memories with provenance, stable
  `mem://memories/<id>` citations and PostgreSQL lexical recall.
- Idempotent `POST /v1/memories`, scoped `GET /v1/memories/{id}`, CLI
  `mem remember` / `mem memory` and MCP `mem_remember` / `mem_memory_get`.
- Authorization-bound cursor pagination and a bounded-summary memory ledger.
- Auditable memory feedback (`useful`, `not_useful`, `pin`, `unpin`),
  optimistic archive/restore transitions and retry-safe forgetting across the
  API, CLI, MCP and Web control surfaces.
- Context Packs that can recall files, structured memories or both through
  `source=all|file|memory`, with kind filters and context-size budgets.
- Explicit partial-retrieval warnings when one Context Pack lane fails.
- Architecture decision record for immutable memory occurrences.
- `mem auth status` for verifying the current token and reporting workspace
  access.
- Reproducible, project-specific validation for Go, Worker, Web, PostgreSQL
  migrations/race paths and isolated process-level HTTP/CLI/MCP acceptance,
  backed by repository CI.
- Issue-first contribution, triage, review, security, and community governance
  standards.
- Pull request policy and CI jobs for Go, the Python worker, and the Web
  application.
- Go and Python coverage artifacts plus verified Go, Python, and Web build
  artifacts.
- Checked-in Go and Python protobuf stubs for reproducible fresh-clone builds.

### Changed

- Checkpoint history lists now return bounded summaries; full handoff payloads
  and evidence references require an explicit checkpoint get or resume.
- Retired the built-in ask/chat path. mem now returns evidence while the
  calling Agent owns reasoning and answer generation.
- `mem_context` now defaults to `source=all`, so evidence may identify a
  structured memory instead of carrying `file_id`. Existing file-only clients
  should request `source=file`; other clients should branch on
  `source_kind/source_id`.
- Bound Agent tokens and retrieval to a workspace and canonical path scope.
- Track the actual embedding provider used by an index and fail closed for
  legacy vectors whose provider cannot be proven.
- Namespaced login, logout and token management under `mem auth`; legacy
  top-level paths remain hidden compatibility aliases with deprecation
  warnings.
- Inherit organization-wide contribution, issue, pull-request, conduct, and
  support defaults from `fullstack-ai-infra/.github`; keep only `mem`-specific
  development, security, triage, ownership, release, and validation rules in
  this repository.
- Align pull-request policy with the inherited controlled exceptions for
  trusted Dependabot updates and maintainer-labeled security advisories.
- Removed the repository-specific cloud-model credential and model-probing
  helpers. Core Agent memory remains model-independent; optional indexing
  providers stay behind the Worker contract.

### Security

- Exclude credentials, tokens, provider secrets, runtime state and derived
  indexes from workspace bundles; carry only hashed memory idempotency keys.
- Bound transfer time, archive bytes, expanded metadata/records and concurrent
  operations; use `0700` spool directories and `0600` temporary files.
- Keep duplicate-content file entries independent after restore so deleting
  one object key cannot break another file.
- Derive workspace, actor and token provenance on the server instead of
  trusting client-supplied identity.
- Hide absent and out-of-scope memories behind the same not-found contract.
- Bound remember request/content/metadata fields and reject unknown JSON
  fields, malformed source hashes and idempotency-key conflicts.
- Prevent folder deletion from silently deleting active or archived memories.
- Re-authorize the persisted path on idempotent memory replay, preventing an
  old path and key from exposing a record after its folder is moved.
- Require compare-and-swap state versions and hashed idempotency keys for
  memory writes; forgotten records clear their payload, path, creator and
  request fingerprint, retain only a generic retry-safe tombstone, and never
  re-enter list or recall results.
- Escape terminal control/bidirectional sequences in human-readable memory
  output and reject them in new virtual paths.
- Return bounded feedback/lifecycle control projections so MCP mutations
  cannot echo full untrusted memory payloads into an Agent context.
- Prevent checkpoint-list pages from amplifying up to 200 complete handoff
  payloads and reference arrays into one Agent context.

### Fixed

- Serialized folder prefix mutations with folder, file, memory and checkpoint
  writers so concurrent renames cannot split a subtree or leave a file path
  pointing at a differently named folder.
- Made `same_person` ranking use directional source-person coverage and stable
  file-ID tie-breaking so a full person-set match ranks ahead of a partial
  match and equal candidates are selected deterministically.
- Align the Worker protobuf/gRPC runtime floors with the checked-in generated
  stubs and verify that contract in regression tests.
- Generate Go protobuf stubs directly into their destination instead of
  deleting a repository-root `github.com/` directory after generation.
- Preserve the primary Web acceptance failure when browser or Vite cleanup
  also fails.

# Testing and validating mem

This is the reproducible test contract for `mem`. It separates hermetic
regression, PostgreSQL integration, process-level service acceptance and
model-quality evaluation so a skipped external dependency cannot be mistaken
for a pass.

## 1. Supported validation environment

Checked-in CI fixes the versions below. Local validation must use the listed
major versions or compatible patch releases:

| Component | Required baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Go | 1.25.x (`server/go.mod`) |
| Node.js / npm | Node 24.x with the checked-in `package-lock.json` |
| Python | 3.11 or 3.12 |
| Python package manager | `uv`, with the checked-in `worker/uv.lock` |
| Browser | Playwright Chromium or an installed Google Chrome |
| Database integration | Docker Compose v2 and `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` |
| Process acceptance | `curl`, `jq`, Docker Compose v2 |

The default regression suite does not need Redis, MinIO, Ollama, a cloud
provider or any API key. The Web acceptance tests use MSW fixtures. Worker
tests use fakes except for the explicitly opt-in visual-model evaluation.

The two checked-in workflows have distinct responsibilities. `ci.yml` verifies
generated protobufs, coverage and release-build artifacts;
`memory-validation.yml` verifies repository metadata, the complete
Agent-memory regression, owned-database migrations and process-level
HTTP/CLI/MCP acceptance. Their shared toolchain and service versions must stay
aligned. Component tests intentionally overlap where artifact production and
the Agent-memory contract need independent evidence.

## 2. Bootstrap a clean checkout

From the repository root:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

This runs the following reproducible setup:

```bash
(cd server && go mod download)
(cd worker && uv sync --locked --extra test && make proto)
(cd web && npm ci && npx playwright install chromium)
```

On a clean Linux host, install Playwright's system packages as well:

```bash
(cd web && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium)
```

Expected result: every command exits `0`; the checked-in Worker protobuf stubs
are regenerated without a diff; Web dependencies and one Playwright browser
are installed. No service is started and no user data is created.

## 3. Hermetic regression

Run all DB-free checks:

```bash
make test
make test-race
```

`make test` executes:

- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` and uncached `go test ./...`;
- Worker `pytest` through the locked `uv` environment;
- Web typecheck, ESLint, production build;
- the Memory and Workspace Transfer browser acceptance suites.

`make test-race` executes the high-risk Go memory, handoff, transfer, API,
client, tool, CLI and MCP packages with the race detector.

Expected result: both commands exit `0`; Go packages report `ok`; Worker tests
pass with only the real-model evaluation skipped; Web acceptance prints its
success summary; no `WARNING: DATA RACE` appears.

Important: the Go suite intentionally unsets `MEM_TEST_DB`. PostgreSQL tests
therefore do not run in this phase and must not be claimed as covered by
`make test`.

Individual component entry points are:

```bash
make test-server
make test-worker
make test-web
```

## 4. Disposable PostgreSQL environment

Start the isolated test database:

```bash
make test-env-up
```

It listens only on `127.0.0.1:55432` by default and creates
`mem_integration_test` as a control database. It does not reuse the development
database or volumes. The Makefile derives a stable, checkout-specific Compose
project name so another clone's test environment is not stopped by cleanup.
Override the host port or project only when necessary, and use the same values
for `test-env-up` and `test-env-down`:

```bash
MEM_TEST_PROJECT=mem-test-review-42 MEM_TEST_PG_PORT=55433 make test-env-up
```

Run migration and database-backed regression:

```bash
make test-integration
make test-integration-race
```

When overriding the port, pass the matching URL:

```bash
MEM_TEST_DB='postgres://mem:mem@127.0.0.1:55433/mem_integration_test?sslmode=disable' \
  make test-integration
```

Before any write, the runner parses the effective pgx configuration, connects
and checks `current_database()`. A URL path cannot disguise a different
`dbname`. The control database is never downgraded. For each phase, the runner
creates a randomly named `mem_verify_*_test` database with a 256-bit ownership
nonce recorded both in the returned DSN and a protected marker table. Cleanup
connects to the target and verifies the exact database name, server role and
marker before it can drop anything. The control role therefore needs
`CREATEDB`; the checked-in Compose user already has it. The runner then:

1. validates migrations on a fresh owned database and applies `0001` through
   the declared head;
2. asserts the current privacy schema, performs the explicit `13 → 11 → 13`
   rollback round trip, and asserts both intermediate schema states;
3. creates separate fresh databases for normal and race runs, then executes
   the real PostgreSQL memory, handoff, workspace-transfer, HTTP-router,
   folder/file path-locking, folder-lifecycle and relator tests serially; and
4. fails if any required integration test is skipped.

Required tests:

- `TestMemoryPostgres`
- `TestHandoffPostgres`
- `TestWorkspaceTransferPostgres`
- `TestHandoffCrossAgentHTTPIntegration`
- `TestMemoryPathLifecycleIntegration`
- `TestWorkspacePathLockingIntegration`
- `TestFilePathLockingIntegration`
- `TestRecomputePerson`

Expected result: migrations reach the declared current head (currently `13`),
both rollback-state assertions pass, every named test prints `PASS`, all
commands exit `0`, and the race run reports no data race.

Cleanup is explicit and destructive only to the isolated Compose project:

```bash
make test-env-down
```

This removes only the derived (or explicitly supplied) test project,
containers, network and tmpfs-backed database state. It does not touch the
normal development Compose project, another checkout's test project or
`.dev/` data.

## 5. Process-level API, CLI and MCP acceptance

Run the isolated, model-free process test:

```bash
make test-acceptance
```

The script owns a per-run Compose project, random loopback PostgreSQL/MinIO
ports, an ephemeral database/store and a new memd process on an atomically
locked, twice-preflighted loopback port. It builds the current CLI, MCP adapter
and a standard-library MCP test client. The scenario creates real data outside
a path-scoped Agent token and proves that get/list/context cannot reveal it,
then proves HTTP remember/replay/conflict/model-free context. The current CLI
and MCP adapter both read full memory detail with citation/provenance, discover
tasks, list bounded checkpoint summaries and fetch one complete checkpoint
through the same real memd/PostgreSQL service. The MCP client waits for the
`initialize` response before sending `notifications/initialized`, then drives
real `tools/call → HTTP → PostgreSQL` remember, checkpoint inspection,
feedback, archive, restore and logical forget. Archive must remove the memory
from recall, restore must make it recallable again, and forget must redact the
live PostgreSQL projection and event actors before the database is destroyed.
The script never reads or writes the user's CLI configuration. Set
`MEM_ACCEPTANCE_HTTP_PORT` only when an explicit fixed port is required.

Expected result: the final line is
`PASS: isolated HTTP, CLI and MCP Agent-memory lifecycle acceptance` and the
command exits `0`. A trap stops only the spawned memd, removes only the
per-run Compose project and deletes its validated repository-local
`.dev/acceptance.*` directory. A cleanup failure changes a successful test to
a failure.

Checkpoint/resume is covered by a real Router + PostgreSQL integration test.
Workspace transfer has PostgreSQL service integration plus independent
handler/client contract tests; it is not represented as a single
Router-to-PostgreSQL end-to-end test. A two-deployment bundle round trip and
real Claude Code/Codex host-process smoke remain release-level manual
acceptance.

## 6. Visual-search quality gate

The default Worker regression proves that original image bytes reach the
visual provider and that only 512-dimensional vectors enter the current
schema. It does not prove multilingual ranking quality.

The real-model gate is opt-in:

```bash
cd worker
uv sync --locked --extra test --extra clip
MEM_RUN_VISUAL_MODEL_EVAL=1 \
MEM_VISUAL_EVAL_PROVIDER='clip:xlm-roberta-base-ViT-B-32:laion5b_s13b_b90k' \
  uv run pytest -q tests/test_multilingual_visual_acceptance.py
```

All English and Chinese ranking assertions must pass before that provider can
be described as validated. Model download failure, timeout or an unavailable
checkpoint is `NOT VERIFIED`, not a pass. See
[VISUAL_SEARCH_BASELINE.md](acceptance/VISUAL_SEARCH_BASELINE.md).

## 7. Regression ledger

Use this table in pull requests and add implementation-specific scenarios:

| ID | Observable acceptance criterion | Command | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | Server, CLI and MCP build and preserve unit contracts | `make test-server` | Exit `0`; no skipped DB claim |
| V2 | Worker processing regressions remain hermetic | `make test-worker` | Exit `0`; real-model gate explicitly skipped |
| V3 | Memory and transfer control surfaces work in a browser | `make test-web` | Typecheck/lint/build and both acceptance suites pass |
| V4 | High-risk Go paths are race-free | `make test-race` | Exit `0`; no data-race warning |
| V5 | Fresh schema, rollback and PostgreSQL semantics hold | `make test-integration` | Migration head and six named tests pass, none skipped |
| V6 | DB concurrency paths are race-free | `make test-integration-race` | Same named tests pass under `-race` |
| V7 | Real service boundaries agree | `make test-acceptance` | HTTP, CLI and MCP share one isolated service; memory citation/provenance, bounded checkpoint listing, full checkpoint get, lifecycle and forget redaction pass |
| V8 | Multilingual visual quality meets the chosen checkpoint | Opt-in command in section 6 | All fixed ranking assertions pass |

## 8. Known limitations

- GitHub CI covers hermetic checks, owned fresh-PostgreSQL
  migration/integration and process-level lifecycle acceptance. It does not
  run external cloud models.
- The two-deployment bundle round trip and real Claude Code/Codex host-process
  smoke remain release-level manual acceptance; checked-in unit/integration
  tests cover the contracts but not those host processes.
- `web/acceptance.mjs` and `web/e2e-smoke.mjs` are legacy, environment-specific
  manual scripts. The standard portable Web gates are
  `npm run test:memory` and `npm run test:transfer`.
- Migration downgrade proves DDL behavior on disposable data. It is not a
  promise that privacy-redacted payloads or discarded identifiers can be
  reconstructed during a production rollback.
- Forget acceptance verifies the live PostgreSQL projection and retained
  minimal event receipts. Physical backup, snapshot and WAL retention remain a
  deployment policy and are not claimed as erased by this test.
- A historical `v11 → v12` fixture containing pre-migration live and forgotten
  rows is not automated yet. The fresh-database round trip does not prove that
  historical-data conversion, so it must be reported as `NOT VERIFIED`.
- Web builds and test caches remain in ignored repository paths. Browser tests
  print their retained screenshot directories under the operating-system temp
  directory; delete only those printed directories after review.
